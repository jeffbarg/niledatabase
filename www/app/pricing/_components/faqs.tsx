        This blog is based on the speaker notes for my talk at Data Day Texas
        2023, and improved with feedback and ideas from my colleagues Ram
        Subramanian and Ewen Cheslack-Postava. If any of these missing database
        capabilities resonate with you and you'd like to try Nile's database,
        please sign up to our waitlist.

        Writing or talking about things databases don't do may sound a bit
        silly. There are obviously many things databases don't do. For example,
        I run many databases and not a single one of them made me coffee this
        morning.
